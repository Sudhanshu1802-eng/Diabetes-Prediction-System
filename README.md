# Diabetes-Prediction-System
The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques .



### Technical Aspect 

- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn. 
- Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku. 
- A user has to put details like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI etc . 
- Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displyed on a new page . 


### Installation 
- Clone this repository and unzip it.
- After downloading, cd into the flask directory.
- Begin a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it.
- Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt

### RUN
- Execute the command: python app.py
